DIGIT RECOGNISER In this project i would be implementing Facial Recognition and Emotion Analysis using neural networks and libraries such as Pandas, NymPy, Tensorflow, Keras etc.
I have made the following progress on my project till now:
1. I began my learning journey by understanding the fundamentals of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib etc.
2. Then i began learning PyTorch for tensors and their operations..
3. Next, I was introduced to neural networks and went through resources on Convolution Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.
4. I learnt about the concepts of forward propagation and back propagations along with their derivation and also learnt about the vaious functions such as activation function, cost function, softmax function, max pooling function and multi-class classification.
5. I also learnt how to train an LSTM model to predict emojis on the basis of input sentences.
6. Then i studied OpenCV for image manipulation for computer vision.
7. After all this, i completed an assignment based on digit recognition using CNN (Code attached as DigitRecogniser.ipynb) which was shared by my mentor.
8. Currently i am going through an article on facial recognition strategy.
